=head1 NAME

Bio::EnsEMBL::Compara::RunnableDB::ProteinTrees::HomologyIDMapping

=cut

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Required inputs:
	- an arrayref of homology_ids
	- URL pointing to the previous release database
	- pointer to current database (usually doesn't require explicit definition)

Example:
	standaloneJob.pl Bio::EnsEMBL::Compara::RunnableDB::ProteinTrees::HomologyIDMapping -input_id "{'homology_ids' => [11,12,13,14,15], 'prev_rel_db' => 'mysql://ensro@compara5/cc21_ensembl_compara_84', 'compara_db' => 'mysql://ensro@compara2/mp14_protein_trees_85'}"

=cut

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Homology ids can change from one release to the next. This runnable detects
the homology id from the previous release database based on the gene members
of the current homologies.

Data should be flowed out to a table to be queried later by pipelines aiming
to reuse homology data.
